The features include danceability, energy, loudness, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo, and genre. Each feature provides insights into different aspects of the songs, such as danceability, intensity, loudness, presence of spoken words, acoustic nature, instrumental content, live performance likelihood, musical positiveness, tempo, and genre. All these features except 'genre' serve as input variables for potential analysis and modeling. The 'genre' attribute serves as the target variable, representing the song genre to be predicted. The dataset offers a comprehensive collection of attributes, making it suitable for exploring and understanding the musical characteristics of a diverse range of songs."],"metadata":{"id":"zBYI-EypaWom"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Load the dataset into a `pandas` data frame."],"metadata":{"id":"DCm1qm1mZwMr"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Write your code here.
